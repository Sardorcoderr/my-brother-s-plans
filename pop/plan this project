The task of this program is that my brother, my nephew, my younger uncle Anwar went to work in Russia and told me to keep an eye on my brother. My brother's house is far from my house
so I have to control it online, then I got an idea, I will create a messenger website and control it through that website,
I write him his daily and weekly plans and I keep track of what time he does and doesn't do these tasks for me and whether he is online or offline!
